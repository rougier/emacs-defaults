*Emacs defaults settings*

The goal of this [[defaults.el][configuration file]] is to materialize what are Emacs default
settings. If you start emacs using =emacs -q= or =emacs -q -l defaults.el= you
should obtain the exact same look and behavior.

*How to contribute*

For any setting that can be set, you can add a one line description and the
actual setting with default value. For example, for line spacing:

#+begin_src lisp
;; Line spacing (in pixels)
(setq-default line-spacing 0)
#+end_src

You can then send me your proposed change through a pull request.

*Note* Since there are amny default key bindings, I only add the most
obvious/frequent ones. Feel free to propose some I may have forgot.
